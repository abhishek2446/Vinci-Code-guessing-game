# Vinci-Code-guessing-game
A project that challenged my problem-solving, logic building, and coding skills in a fun and creative way.  
🚀 Project Milestone Unlocked! 🎮

I'm excited to share that I’ve successfully designed and developed a Vinci Code Guessing Board Game using Python — a project that challenged my problem-solving, logic building, and coding skills in a fun and creative way.

🔍 Key Features of the Game:
✅ Supports 2 to 5 players with dynamic player handling
✅ Implements a unique scoring system:
• Triangle formation: +1 point
• Square formation: +2 points
• Straight line (horizontal, vertical, diagonal): +3 points
✅ Special Spot 9 rule — this spot can only be selected if it results in a valid 3-in-a-row formation

🎯 What I learned from this project:
🔹 Writing clean, modular, and scalable Python code
🔹 Implementing custom game rules and AI-based decision making
🔹 Managing user input validation for multi-player scenarios
🔹 Planning for feature expansion like graphical interfaces
